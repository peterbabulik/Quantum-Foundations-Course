## 🌌 The Philosophy
Most Quantum Mechanics courses start with complex notation ($\langle \psi | \hat{H} | \psi \rangle$).  
**This course starts with Code.**

We believe that if you can program it, you understand it. This repository takes you on a journey from the First Principles of Physics (Planck & Bohr) to running neural networks on utility-scale Quantum Hardware (IBM Heron).

## 🚀 Course Syllabus

### **Part 1: The Birth of the Bit**
Before we had Qubits, we had to discover that nature is pixelated.
*   **The Ultraviolet Catastrophe:** Simulating Planck's Law to fix classical physics.
*   **The Bohr Atom:** Calculating the colors of hydrogen using integer quantization.
*   **The Box:** Solving Schrödinger's equation to see how waves create integers.

### **Part 2: The Geometry of Logic**
Demystifying the "Magic".
*   **Continuum Logic:** Proving that Classical Logic is just Quantum Logic restricted to 90 degrees.
*   **The Unification Engine:** A custom 3D engine to visualize Group Theory (SU2) and rotations.
*   **Entanglement:** Coding a system where information exists in the correlation, not the individual.

### **Part 3: Engineering Reality**
Moving from Theory to Hardware.
*   **The Hilbert Scale:** Visualizing the terrifying exponential growth of state space (2^N).
*   **True Randomness:** A "Quantum Native Entropy Engine" verified against Dieharder statistical tests.
*   **Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE):** Using Tanh decay models to clean signal from noise on real hardware.

### **Part 4: The Intelligent Future**
Where Quantum meets AI and Thermodynamics.
*   **Quantum AI:** Training Hybrid Neural Networks using PyTorch and PennyLane.
*   **50-Qubit Inference:** Running a classifier on the IBM Torino processor.
*   **Probabilistic Computing:** Using P-Bits and Hopfield Networks to solve optimization problems via energy minimization.
