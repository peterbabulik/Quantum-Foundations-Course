    "# Module 2.2: The Entangled System\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Concept:** Entanglement is not magic; it is simply a restriction of the state space. \n",
    "\n",
    "When two qubits ($A$ and $B$) are entangled, they stop being independent 2D vectors and become a single 4D vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The State Space:**\n",
    "1. $|00\\rangle$ (Both 0)\n",
    "2. $|01\\rangle$ (A=0, B=1)\n",
    "3. $|10\\rangle$ (A=1, B=0)\n",
    "4. $|11\\rangle$ (A=1, B=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the system is in the state $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle + |11\\rangle)$, the probabilities for mixed states ($|01\\rangle$ and $|10\\rangle$) are **zero**. Measuring A immediately reveals B because the other options simply do not exist mathematically."
